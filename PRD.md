## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
To create the world's most comprehensive platform for Ableton Live users to discover, share, and collaborate on music production workflows, fostering a global community of electronic music creators.

### Problem Statement
Music producers using Ableton Live often spend countless hours recreating sounds, effects chains, and production techniques that have already been perfected by others. Currently, there's no centralized platform where producers can easily share, discover, and rate complete workflows (effect racks, instrument racks, and production chains) in a structured, searchable manner.

### Solution Overview
Ableton Cookbook is a web-based platform that allows Ableton Live users to scan, upload, share, and discover workflows from the global producer community. Users can rate workflows, follow their favorite producers, and build a personalized library of high-quality production resources.

### Target Market
- Primary: Ableton Live users (beginner to professional level)
- Secondary: Music production educators and students
- Tertiary: Music production communities and collectives

## User Stories & Character Narratives

### Character 1: Maya Chen - The Bedroom Producer
**Background:** Maya is a 24-year-old graphic designer from Portland who produces electronic music in her spare time. She's been using Ableton Live for 2 years and considers herself an intermediate user. She works on ambient and downtempo tracks and struggles with creating professional-sounding bass lines and drum processing chains.

**Goals:**
- Find high-quality bass processing workflows
- Learn from more experienced producers
- Eventually share her own ambient texture techniques

**Pain Points:**
- Spends hours trying to recreate sounds she hears in reference tracks
- Difficulty finding specific types of workflows online
- Lacks confidence in her mixing abilities

#### Feature Story: Workflow Discovery
Maya opens Ableton Cookbook after a frustrating evening trying to recreate a punchy bass sound she heard in a Bonobo track. She navigates to the search interface and filters for "Bass Processing" + "Downtempo" workflows. The platform shows her 15 highly-rated workflows with preview audio clips.

She clicks on a workflow titled "Warm Analog Bass Chain" by producer "VintageVibes" (rated 4.8/5 stars). The workflow page shows:
- Audio preview of before/after processing
- Complete device chain breakdown
- Comments from other users who've used it
- Compatibility information (Ableton Live 11+)
- Download statistics (downloaded 2,847 times)

Maya downloads the .adg file, imports it into her project, and within minutes has the exact bass sound she was looking for. She leaves a 5-star rating and follows VintageVibes to see their future uploads.
