# Feature Specification: Enhanced Nested Chain Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-updating-the-upload`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "updating the upload and analysis feature. The app struggles with nested chains. The app needs to be checking for nested apps better. There are now many test racks in /testRacks that have nested chains. ALL CHAINS must be included this needs to be in the constitution as well."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a community member uploading an Ableton rack with complex nested device chains, I want the platform to accurately analyze and display ALL device chains (including deeply nested ones) so that other users can understand the complete structure and functionality of my rack, leading to better discovery and educational value.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a rack file with nested device chains, **When** I upload it to the platform, **Then** the analysis shows ALL chains including nested ones with proper hierarchy
2. **Given** a rack with multiple levels of nesting (chain within chain within chain), **When** the analysis completes, **Then** each level of nesting is properly identified and displayed
3. **Given** test racks from /testRacks directory with known nested structures, **When** processed by the system, **Then** the analysis matches the expected nested chain configuration
4. **Given** a previously uploaded rack that was missing nested chains, **When** the enhanced analyzer reprocesses it, **Then** the rack information is updated to include all previously missed chains

### Edge Cases
- What happens when nested chains are empty but structurally present?
- How does the system handle chains nested beyond a reasonable depth?
- What occurs when nested chains contain Max for Live devices with custom parameters?
- How are circular references or invalid nesting structures handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect ALL device chains within an uploaded rack file, regardless of nesting depth
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve and display the hierarchical structure of nested chains
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate nested chain analysis against test racks in /testRacks directory
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view the complete chain hierarchy in the rack visualization
- **FR-005**: System MUST update existing rack records when reprocessed with enhanced nested chain analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST log nested chain detection results for debugging and validation purposes
- **FR-007**: Platform MUST constitutionally enforce that ALL CHAINS are included in rack analysis (constitutional amendment required)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle performance implications of deep nesting analysis without timing out
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing rack analysis data while adding nested chain information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Nested Chain**: Represents a device chain that exists within another chain, maintaining parent-child relationships and depth level information
- **Chain Hierarchy**: The complete tree structure of chains within a rack, including all nesting levels and relationships
- **Enhanced Rack Analysis**: Updated rack analysis data that includes comprehensive nested chain information alongside existing device detection

## Constitutional Amendment Requirement

This feature requires an amendment to the Ableton Cookbook Constitution to establish:
- **New Business Rule**: "ALL CHAINS within uploaded rack files MUST be detected and included in analysis, regardless of nesting depth"
- **Analysis Completeness Principle**: Rack analysis cannot be considered complete unless all nested structures are fully detected and preserved
